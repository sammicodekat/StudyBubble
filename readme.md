A fully immersive learning environment, Study Bubble allows users to focus 100% of their attention on the subject they are studying. Our app combines a traditional web-app allowing creation and selection of study decks with a VR 'bubble' that is used for learning. Made using React, Redux, Express and A-Frame, Study Bubble is a practical and modern design that harnesses the immersive power of VR to offer a unique educational experience.
